            <h4>MORE DETAILS</h4>

            <div class="content">
              <p>The Ferrari 288 GTO was first among Ferrari’s lineup of Supercars so designated by the company as
                its decennially produced, limited edition flagship of cars subsequently succeeded by the F40, F50,
                Enzo and La Ferrari which incorporated Ferrari’s latest racing derived technology applied to their
                state of the art road-going cars.</p>

              <p>The 288 GTO (Type F114) was a limited edition, exotic development of Ferrari’s enormously popular
                entry level workhorse, the 308 GTB, and produced in Ferrari’s Maranello factory from 1984 through
                1987. The GTO designation stands for Gran Turismo Omologata (homologated) and a modern homage to
                the landmark 250 GTO
                which served as Ferrari’s flagship from 1962 to 1964</p>

              <p>The 288 GTO was originally designated to participate in the FIA’s Group B category of sports car
                racing which was created as an underclass to the Group C prototype class, and supplanting Group 5
                as the production based GT category. Just as Group C prototypes caught on with sports car
                manufactures, Group B caught the imagination of manufactures such as Audi, Peugeot, Ford and Lancia
                which saw fertile ground for the cars in the World Rally Championship (WRC) and they built
                tremendously powerful four wheel drive production-based cars to compete, transforming the category
                into a golden age for rallying which ran from 1982 until 1986 when the cars were running in excess
                of 1,000BHP and were deemed too powerful and unsafe to continue after driver and spectator deaths
                tarnished the class.</p>

              <p>“Group B rules were intended to regulate racers that were developments of high- performance road
                cars. From the outset there was little or no demand, and consequently no market, for Group B-spec
                GTs.” legendary motorsport photographer and writer John Brooks states. “The cost of producing 200
                examples for homologation was out of the question financially for Porsche and Ferrari who were both
                in a very different commercial position in the mid-80s than they are today”.</p>

              <p>Brooks elaborates, “Only Ferrari and Porsche produced endurance sports cars to Group B
                specifications. Ferrari had Michelotto use the 288 GTO chassis to create the GTO Evoluzione but
                none of the six cars constructed ever made it to the races. The exercise was used to develop
                components and lightweight materials that found their way on to the soon to be launched F40.
                Porsche built just one 961 based on their 959 model, it finished 7th at Le Mans in 1986 and was
                partly burnt out the following year after an accident on the Sunday morning”.</p>

              <p>From the beginning, Enzo Ferrari’s entire business plan was putting racing technology to work in
                his road cars as he had starting building and selling road-going cars to finance his racing
                ambitions. Ultimately, the first production turbo Ferrari engine appeared in the 288 GTO which
                embodied turbo technology Ferrari was gaining in Formula One at the time. The 288 references the
                GTO’s 2.8 liter DOHC, 4-valve V8 with IHI twin-turbochargers, cooled by Behr air-to-air
                intercoolers and featuring Weber- Marelli fuel injection.</p>
